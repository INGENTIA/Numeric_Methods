## Introduction

The Runge-Kutta method is a numerical approach used to approximate the solution of initial value problems (IVPs) of ordinary differential equations. It offers higher accuracy compared to simpler methods like Euler's method and is widely employed in engineering simulations, control systems, and scientific modeling.

## Runge-Kutta Method

The basic idea of the Runge-Kutta method is to iteratively update the solution by considering the slope at different points within the interval. The method comes in various orders, with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) being one of the most popular due to its balance between accuracy and computational complexity.

For an ODE of the form: dy/dx = f(x, y), where y(x_0) = y_0, the RK4 method's iterative formula is given by:

1. k1 = h * f(x_n, y_n)
2. k2 = h * f(x_n + h/2, y_n + k1/2)
3. k3 = h * f(x_n + h/2, y_n + k2/2)
4. k4 = h * f(x_n + h, y_n + k3)

Here, h is the step size, x_n is the current value of x, and y_n is the current approximation of y. The new approximation y_{n+1} is calculated as:

y_{n+1} = y_n + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6
