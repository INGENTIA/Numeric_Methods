## Introduction

Numerical methods play a crucial role in engineering simulations and analyses, allowing us to solve complex mathematical problems that arise in fields such as structural analysis, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and more. This repository demonstrates the implementation and application of various numerical methods in solving engineering problems.

Numerical methods are fundamental techniques used in scientific computing to solve mathematical problems that may not have analytical solutions. This repository aims to demonstrate how to implement and use these methods in a programming environment.

## Implemented Methods

Currently, this repository includes examples of the following numerical methods, tailored for engineering applications:

- [Newton-Raphson Method](newton_raphson/)
- [Euler's Method](eulers_method/)
- [Simpson's Rule](simpsons_rule/)
- [Runge-Kutta Method](runge_kutta/)

Each method is implemented in multiple programming languages for educational purposes.

## Usage

For each method, you can find a dedicated directory with code examples in different programming languages. Each example includes comments to explain the implementation and usage.

To run the examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: 
2. Navigate to the specific method's directory: `cd newton_raphson`
3. Choose your preferred programming language: `cd python` or `cd java`, for instance.
4. Follow the instructions in the README file of that directory to run the example.

## Contributing
